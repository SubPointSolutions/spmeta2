## Welcome to SPMeta2

SPMeta2 is a hassle-free fluent API for code-based SharePoint artefact provisioning.
It offers a consistent provisioning API via SSOM/CSOM for SharePoin 2010, 2013 and O365.

SPMeta2 is all you need to have a testable, repeatable and upgradable way to provision fields, content types, lists, list views, webs,
custom actions, security groups, permission levels, web parts, wiki pages, web part pages, publishing pages and so on – in fact,
more than 100 (sic, more than a hundred) different artifacts and even more scenarios.

Sounds exciting? Have a look around, let us know how it goes.
