SPMeta2 is all you need to have a **testable**, **repeatable** and **upgradable** way to provision fields, content types, lists, list views, webs, 
custom actions, security groups, permission levels, web parts, wiki pages, web part pages, publishing pages and so on - in fact, 
**more than 100 (sic, more than a hundred) different artifacts** and **even more scenarios**.

This page contains various scenarious which can be covered by SPMeta2 library. We constantly updates samples and API, so this page is changed as we have more features or samples.

If you cannot find scenario you are after just [open a new suggestion](https://subpointsolutions.uservoice.com) to introduce a new feature or give us a shot at [Yammer network](https://www.yammer.com/spmeta2feedback).
