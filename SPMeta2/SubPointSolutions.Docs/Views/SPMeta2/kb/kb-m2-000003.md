## Content type operations within a list

### Problem
M2 can't resolve a content type by giving ID within a list

## Explanation
Correct, M2 can't resolve a content type by ID withib a list. By design, SharePoint API limitation.

The thing has to do with the SharePoint API and "BestMatch" method wich would try to find the best content type much within a list by giving ID.
Target list might have several content types inherited from the same parent, yet the actual, real ID of the content type within a list will be unique to that list - SharePoint adds additional GUID to the content type ID.
In that case the SharePoint's API best match would not work correctly returning almost random results and incorrect content types.

### Solution
Use content type name while adding, hiding or deleting content types within a list.
