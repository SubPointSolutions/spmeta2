## AddXXX() / AddHostXXX() methods

### Problem
It is not clear what is the different between AddXXX() and AddHostXXX() methods.

## Explanation
Once M2 model gets provisioned, all non-existing artifacts get created, and all existing artifacts get updated.
All model nodes are built with .AddXXX() method.

Sometimes we don't want to update or change artifacs: for instance out of the box artifacts such as Pages list, SitePages list.
In that case use .AddXXX() method for non-existing artifacts, and use .AddHostXXX() method for artifacts which either come with SharePoint or already exist.

### Solution
* Use AddXXX() methods on non-existing artifacts
* Use AddHostXXX() method on existing, out of the box artifacts.
