SPMeta2 introduces a domain model providing set of definitions for most of the SharePoint artifacts.

Before you begin, make sure you are familiar with the following concepts:

* [SPMeta2 basics](/spmeta2/basics/)
* [SPMeta2 definitions](/spmeta2/definitions/)

### Content type definitions
Here is a list of "typed" web part related definition by SPMeta2. 
Every single definition is mapped to SharePoint CSOM/SSOM object during the provision and avialable via OnProvisioning/OnProvisioned events.

### Missed definition?

The SPMeta2 library is being actively developed: new features, enhancements and fixes are constantly added. Hence, it is possible that some definitions have not been implemented yet. 

Just give us a shot if you miss something. We are keen to hear your feedback:
