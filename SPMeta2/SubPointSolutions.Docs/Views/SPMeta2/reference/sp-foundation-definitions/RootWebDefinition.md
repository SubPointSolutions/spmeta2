
Root web provision is enabled via RootWebDefinition object.

There are two cases for which RootWebDefinition could be of use:

* We need to rename Title/Description of the root web
* We need to 'lookup' the root web to provision content on root web

If Title/Description are not provided, provision does not change anything.

Both CSOM/SSOM object models are supported.
